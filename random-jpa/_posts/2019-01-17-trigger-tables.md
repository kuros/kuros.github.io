Random-JPA provides a way to load tables generated by triggers. Although it only supports fetching of tables generated by trigger and does load entities if only column values are modified.

**Note: If entity is declared as Trigger tables, random values will not be generated for this entity.**

Let us say that we have trigger which logs history of all the bank transaction taking place. "Transaction" has two foreign keys, one maps to personId and other to accountId.

```java
final JPAContextFactory jpaContextFactory = JPAContextFactory
    .newInstance(Database.MY_SQL, entityManager);
jpaContextFactory.withTriggers(Trigger.of(Transaction.class)
        .withLink(Transaction_.personId, Person_.id)
        .withLink(Transaction_.accountId, Account_.accountId));
```

So when you load trigger table "Transaction" it will query the table to fetch row with mapped personId & accountId
